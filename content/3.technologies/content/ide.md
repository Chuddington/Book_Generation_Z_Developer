We need to talk about your IDE! (Integrated development environment) 

How much time have you spent: choosing it, customizing it, making it suit your development workflow, making it automate actions that you do as a developer, making it automatically execute tests

Your IDE is one of the most important tools in your arsenal and the more time you spend looking after it, the better a programmer you will be:

The IDE is like a car in a race that you are the driver. You really need to spend time caring about it, since your performance as a developer will be affected by how effective your IDE is for the task at hand

 Note that this doesn't mean that the most feature rich IDE will be better. You need to pick the best tool for the job:
 - for example Visual Studio has tons of features but that made it quite slow (and Windows specific), which is why other editors (like Atom) started to gain traction. Microsoft then released VS Code which is much more lightweight and effective.
 - Sometimes Notepad or Vim are the best IDES
 - I quite like the JetBrains suite of tools (WebStorm for Node , PyCharm for Python and IntelliJ for Java)
 - Eclipse can also be a great editor (specially if you customize it)
 - Cloud IDEs (like Cloud9) can be amazing in some cases (in one project I had a special docker instance that added Cloud9 to a node application)
 
 One of the key requirements for me in the IDE is the ability to:

 - run tests quickly (once you stopped typing)
 - run tests affected by the latest code changes
 - show code coverage in the IDE

At the moment the only place where I have seen those features happening is in NCrunch (for .NET) and WallabyJS (for node/javascript). The auto test execution capability that some IDEs have, are a decent compromise, but not as effective (and productive as those two tools)

The key point is that you need to take the time and care to chose your IDE, since it has the power to dramatically increase your productivity
