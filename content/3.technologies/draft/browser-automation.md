**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - code the browser
    - write electron (or selenium) scripts
    - write code on Inspector window (Dev Tools)
 - amazing feeling when you actually automate something as simple as an login screen
 - most companies have not solved how to do this effectively (for example to automatically test for site performance and security issues/problems)
 - understand the power of automating the browser
 - ability to create an API from any website (worse case scenario is to automate the browser)
 - understand how bots work
