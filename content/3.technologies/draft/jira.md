[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a web application that is widely used by development, engineering and technical teams to manage they day to day tasks/activities.

We (at Photobox Group Security) use Jira extensively in our day-to-day activities, where not only it helps us to track our tasks and risks, we create tons of custom Jira Workflows and write custom applications.

We basically use JIRA as an graph database (see [Creating a Graph Based Security Organisation](https://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/creating-a-graph-based-security-organisation-devseccon-keynote-81345667) ) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) as a way to display the information stored in JIRA.

The key point I want to make here is that the tools that we use in the enterprise need to be customised and extended (in order to make them work).

Being able to write these customisations and understanding at a much deeper level (when compared to 'normal' or 'power' users) what is possible with these tools, is a massive competive advantage.

In fact if you are able to write custom JIRA workflows that are usable by a development team, that is a massive competitive advantage for you, and it will make you highly employable today.

**Use Jira in your life**

Create Jira projects for your life activities (with Epics to track group of tasks)

Create a Kanban board for your personal tasks and Epics.

Create custom workflows and learn how to manage Jira. This will give you tons of confidence when using Jira in the real world (or when intervewing)

And since Atlassian has evaluation version for their cloud version of Jira, there isn't any cost to try this.

Now you have no excuse to not having used Jira before (at a level more advanced that most corporate users and the developers interviewing you)
