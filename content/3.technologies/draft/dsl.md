DSL (Domain Specific Language)

...

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - what are they
 - why are they so important
 - abstractions layers
   - make the code as simple as posible
   - .net extension methods are a great compiler trick to achieve very clean domain(ish) languages with strongly type
   - why support for static compilation and code complete is very important (groovy and javascript problem)
 - refactor the code to make it aligned with the bsuiness functions it is execution
