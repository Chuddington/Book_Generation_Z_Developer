**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - use github as your personal back up and time machine
 - build on top of Open source
 - with a proprietary service on top
 - interesting open source challengers:
   - GitLab
   - Gogs https://github.com/gogits
 - amazing innovation, how many times it pushes to production everyday. GH is one of the best development teams in the world
 - Github is your CV
    - shows how you code, how you interact with others
    - your commits and pull requests show your voice
    - your accepted pull requests by other Open Source repos (the more popular the better) should go on your CV (they are your badges of honor)
    - number of people/projects using your tools ia validation of your skills (much better than LinkedIn recommentation system)
  - you should have a long tail of projects and forks (altough beware of the polution caused by forks that you don't contribute to). Keep this curated, since after all it is your research playground
  - Github Bug Bounty programme (Gamification)
  - use Github commit dashboard (a box for everyday that you did a commit) as a way to check 'how am I doing' (since you don't want to see big periods with no commits (warning: don't go over the top and try to have a commit EVERY day, sometimes it is good to rest and not commit anything)
  - Use GitHub projects to understand the Kanban workflow
