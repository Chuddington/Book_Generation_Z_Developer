**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - Workpress, medium, Blogger
 - find your voice
 - hard part are the first 50 blog posts
 - it is really hard to write
 - view it as an exercise
 - any feedback is healthy
 - amazing feeling when one post gain traction (and it referenced in sites like redit)
 - comments are gold (get rid of any kind of spam or link-bait in comments)
 - use your blog to ask questions (with data behind your question and the paths you have tried)
    - don't worry about how rusty and rough they are, what matter is that you have started to publish
    - it is your blog and you are learning
 - write about things you are doing on the day-to-day. explain your path and personal stories about making it to work
 - write for your future self
 - key concept: "answer questions made to you with a blog" (great way to write good/relevant content and scale your time (specially important when you get asked the same question by multiple people/colleagues))
    - i.e. when somebody asks you a question, write a blog post with the answer and send them the link to it

 - Blog titles are very important (since they help with SEO a lot)
