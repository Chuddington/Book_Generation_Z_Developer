title : Micro-Services
status: draft

...

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - explain concepts
 - where they work great
 - Swagger.io
 - problem of understanding how they work together
 - move from a 'blob of code' (the monolith app) into a 'large blog' (the constlation of Micro-services that nobody really has a good understanding of all moving parts and inter-dependencies)
    - this is where Chaos Monkey is a great tool to understand side effects
