**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - "For a typical author, obscurity is a far greater threat than piracy." Tim O'Reilly on [Piracy is Progressive Taxation, and Other Thoughts on the Evolution of Online Distribution](http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html)
 - how CC is changing research
    - for example collaboration of code and datasets on cancer research
 - the amount of data that is being shared today is hugo
    - show examples from the multiple visualisation's books (and websites)
    - show example of data released by the UK
        - https://data.gov.uk/ which uses http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/ (compatible with Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 )

  - more and more there is an moral and techical argument that all data created by government should be released under an creative commons license, and all code paid by the government should be released under an open source license
  - publishing your research under an CC license is harder than it looks. It means that you have made the paradigm shift from close to open.
     - It means that you now view your value as someone who can execute ideas (and are happy to share your creations)
     - anybody can have ideas, the execution is the hard part
        - in fact deciding what NOT to do is that hard part (what ideas to say NO is one of the most important decisions to do)
            - this is easy when you have a good vision of the journey ahead.
