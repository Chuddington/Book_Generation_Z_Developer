Choosing which license you chose to share your work is one of the most important decisions you make in your professional life.

You can either go down a path where you think that everything you create (outside paid work) is super precious 


here is definition from Wikipedia [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) page

> A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of their own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work



### This book and Creative Commons license variations

Although all CC licenses allow content to be shared, some have more restrictions:
 
 - **Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0** - need to attribute and use the same CC license (this has a 'viral' effect since it forces changes to also have a CC license)
 - **Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0** - need to attribute and don't allow changes
 - **Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0** -  need to attribute, don't allow commercial use and don't allow changes 
 
 I don't like the licenses above since they put restrictions on how the content can be used (which is against my views of sharing, but for companies or individuals that are new to CC, these are good first steps.

 For reference here is a table with the multiple license's variations:

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - "For a typical author, obscurity is a far greater threat than piracy." Tim O'Reilly on [Piracy is Progressive Taxation, and Other Thoughts on the Evolution of Online Distribution](http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html)
 - how CC is changing research
    - for example collaboration of code and datasets on cancer research
 - the amount of data that is being shared today is hugo
    - show examples from the multiple visualisation's books (and websites)
    - show example of data released by the UK
        - https://data.gov.uk/ which uses http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/ (compatible with Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 )

  - more and more there is an moral and technical argument that all data created by government should be released under an creative commons license, and all code paid by the government should be released under an open source license
  - publishing your research under an CC license is harder than it looks. It means that you have made the paradigm shift from close to open.
     - It means that you now view your value as someone who can execute ideas (and are happy to share your creations)
     - anybody can have ideas, the execution is the hard part
        - in fact deciding what NOT to do is that hard part (what ideas to say NO is one of the most important decisions to do)
            - this is easy when you have a good vision of the journey ahead.

 - when choosing which company to work for, take into account their current Open Source strategy and culture for open sourcing internally developed technology (this should have an impact on your choices)
