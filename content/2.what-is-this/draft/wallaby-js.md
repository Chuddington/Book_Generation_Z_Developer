**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - why wallabyJS is a massive paradigm shift and why is it so good
     - real time test execution
     - only execution of tests affected by changes
     - ability to see the code coverage in real-time
     - ability to easily just run one test
         - which with the real-time coverage, provides a much better way to debug that the normal 'debug/breakpoint model'
     - ability to run all the tests impacted by an code change (blast radious of code changes)

 - the power of sub-second execution
    - when tests require more than 1 sec to run, there is some problem somewhere
    - only full end-to-end test should take that long
    - power of 'surrogate dependencies' (link to presentation)
 - we need similar capabilities for cloud infrasture
 - add ideas from Bret Victor's [Inventing on principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366) presentation (name the need for inventors to be close to what they create and have quick feedback)
