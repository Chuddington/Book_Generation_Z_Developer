title: WallabyJS and NodeJS
---

...

---

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - why wallabyJS is a massive paradigm shift and why is it so good
     - real time test execution
     - only execution of tests affected by changes
     - ability to see the code coverage in real-time
     - ability to easily just run one test
         - which with the real-time coverage, provides a much better way to debug that the normal 'debug/breakpoint model'

 - why NodeJS took the world by storm
 - the power of async code
 - generating 20k requests with a couple lines of code
 - coding at the speed of thought (and type)
 - node history (based on chrome's V8)
 - the node forking incident (io.js)
    - why it was so important
    - why java could had done with a fork like that
