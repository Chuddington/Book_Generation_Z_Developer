**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - power of assembly, the importance of learning how to code in ASM
 - how assembly relates to bytecode in .Net (MSIL) and Java
 - spectre vulnerability
 - I learned how to code assembly by hand
    - a bit difficult (I was 13 at the time) but I had only one book and no internet
    - manually translated assembly code into binary (I didn't had an asm compiler at the time)
    - I was learning massively about architecture, memory layout, programming, etc...
    - totally worth it
 - when I was 16 I programmed on the Motorola 68000 which was much easier and more interresting (the 68000 CPU was used in the Amiga, and was much more powerful that the x86 architecure (we still used today))
 - my peek and poke moment: 'change a pixel on screen' (and falling in love with programming)
