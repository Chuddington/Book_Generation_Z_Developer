 - explain key concepts
 - the creation of the Open Source idea and movement (how an how)
 - Richard Stallman - Copy Left, GNU, philosopher
    - explain the GNU/Linux situation
 - Security will push code to be open ('who '
    - [Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf)
 - companies using & developing open source
 - open source business models
 - I was called a communist many times (in early open source conversations)
 - "Open source as won, but Gen Z is not aware of it"
 - When you open source an app or code, what will happen next is : Nothing!
    - it is veru hard to create a community around an open source project
    - what you will have done (with adding the license file to your code (which is all it takes, assuming you wrote all the code so far)), is to create future opportunities for that code and sent a strong message about your agenda (i.e. you are not going to lock in the future the users that are using your current code today).
       - you are allowing somebody (which could be you) in the future to use your code
       - you are also protecting your research, so that if you move companies, you can still use that code (there is nothing worse for a programmer than to having to rewrite something that was working ok (specially when it is a framework that supports a particular workflow)

 - big success of companies collaborating internally externally (i.e. internal collaboration between different teams via open source code)
    - although most devs have access to all code, the number of cross-team pull requests is very low (open source license help a lot with this)
    - allowing other to use your code is a great way to find programmers to hire or companies to buy
    - the myth of the company that will take your code and just run with it (they will be massive locked to your code)
        - example of team that created a fork of Chrome (to add security features) and couldn't keep up with Chrome's development speed
        - the open source tax (when you don't contribute back your changes)
  - companies should pay developers to work on open source apps/modules that are used in the company.
    - my experience with helping an open source project (that we used), and then getting help from a key developer from that project in a hard problem that we were having

 - Question: "Why don't you open source your code?"
    - I bet the answer is a combination of:
        - "I don't think my code is good enough"
        - "I'm embarrassed about my code"
        - "Nobody will want to use my code"
    - the first thing to understand is that I have heard these same excuses from all sorts of developers and companies, for code in all sorts of quality and completeness.
    - this is your [Lizard brain](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/lizard-brain) in action (making excuses of why you shouldn't do something)
    - the key is to just do it (add the license and slowly staring building the community)



**The Cathedral and the Bazaar

  - In this book/essay Raymond provides 19 lessons which are still as relevant today (2018) as when they were published (1998)

     - Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
     - Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
     - Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month)
     - If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
     - When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
     - Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
     - Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
     - Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
     - Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
     - If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
     - The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
     - Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
     - Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
     - Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
     - When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
     - When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
     - A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
     - To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
     - Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
