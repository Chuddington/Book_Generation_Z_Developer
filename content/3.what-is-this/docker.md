title: Docker
---


**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - explain difference with VMs (and Vagrant)
 - Just a process
 - its a virtual enviroment created by the linux kernel
 - really good security features (in a way it is the future of computing)
 - the path to 'Serverless'
 - explain Kubernetes (how it come from Google's Borg)
    - this container's capability was why google grew so fast and innovated so much in the last decade
 - add some technical examples of how to use docker (and how easy it is)
 - why docker image development environment is so powerful and fast (explain the concept of images commits)
    - if you don't understand git and virtual file systems you will struggle to understand git
    - repeatable bash scritps
    - testing of docker images and builds is still a very imature space (no good tools, IDEs and Test Runners). I played with BATS but it wasn't very good
        - we need TDD for docker development
        - big comptetitive advantage in the market place if you understand these concepts

 - a very good research area is the visualisation and mapping or docker environment (namely who is talking to who)
