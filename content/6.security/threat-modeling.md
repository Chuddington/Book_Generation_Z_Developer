Threat Modeling is a technique used by security professionals to understand the side effects of a particular code journey or pattern.



**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - helps with the two curses of developers
    - Changes to the Brief
    - Lack of accountability for those changes
 - Threat modeling allows the brief to be locked, since new features will require a review of the threat modeling
 - Not doing threat models means that that the 'Security implications of X have not been considered' (X is a project, a sprint, a new feature, a new integration with 3rd party, etc...)   
 - Threat model leads to the creation of risks which are then given to the business owners
