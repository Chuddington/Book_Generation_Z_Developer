**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - find them
 - you will be surprised by how approachable they are
    - if you have the right attitude, the mentors will see themselves in you (which is why most have a soft spot to help)
 - Books and publications are great mentors
 - use the ones that you can physically or digially reach
 - push your company or school to create mentor network (based on Slack for example)
    - this is what we did at Photobox Group Security
