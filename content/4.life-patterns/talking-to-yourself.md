**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - It is very important to be comfortable in talking to yourself digital 
     - on Git comments
     - on blogs
     - on twitter
     - on slack
 - this helps others to understand your thinking and actions
 - it leaves your workflow behind, since it explains how when from A to F (since you are leaving text and screenshots of the A, B,C,D,E and F steps). In fact, in practice these will be the A,B, G, M,Z, T, E, D and F steps, since in most cases the steps are not linear and in sequence)
