...

**Topics to cover and ideas**


 - Habits are really powerful and are what allows for long term changes to occur
 - Find out what good and bad habits you have
 - Map out the motivation that you have for them
 - Focus on changing in small increments 
 - Sometimes doing something in a binary way (yes/no) is easier (for example drink vs no drink, smoke vs no smoke)
 - this also applies to teams and how you interact with others
 - starting an ambitious habit and then failing can back fire
 - reverse engineer your life and optimise it for maximizing your opportunities
 - good habits can actually free up your time and give you more flexibility 
 - some ideas for habits to get (from a technology/development point of view)
    - think in graphs
    - create automated test and deployment environments (even for the smallest project)
    - try to understand how things/apps/code/functions work (i.e. 'follow the packet')
    - using programming thinking for normal business challenges
    - align the code in a way that makes it easier to read
