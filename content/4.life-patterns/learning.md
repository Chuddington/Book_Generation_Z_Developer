Do you know how to learn?

Learning to learn is one of the most important skills that you can have, and in fact, that is the main skill to learn from school. This is ironic, since usually very little time is spent at school in learning out to learn.

Learning is like a muscle, the more you do it, the better your become. And just like in sports, there are specific techniques that you can use to learn more efficiently.

As a developer if you are not passionate about learning, you are on the wrong job!

It is not about learning one Language or Framework. You need to learn 10+ languages and be on a constant learning curve. Each language will tech you something new (don't worry, only the first 5 will be hard, after that, the key paradigms will always feel familiar). For example, it is very hard to learn about functional programming until you start coding in Node or in Scala (after banging your head against the wall for a bit, it will click, and you will love its power and ability to write really simple code)

Application Security will take this to another level, since you will be asked to code review in all sorts of languages (which is great, since that is the best way to learn)

The reality is that we are in age of the 'professional amateur', where you very rarely have time to really specialise in a particular language or technology. And when you do specialise, if you are not careful, you will be stuck in the past and be the one that is responsible for maintaining the legacy applications.

What you really need to be worried about is when you stop learning. Ironically this can happen the more you move up the company's corporate ladder. There is a big trap of management promotions, which pushes highly technical and proficient developers into 'management' or 'architectural' positions (this is also called the [Peters Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) where "employees are promoted to the maximum of their incompetence").  When this happens, these highly knowledgeable professionals have very little time to spend on technical issues, spending most of of their on meetings, spreadsheets and 'non learning activities'

My view is that no matter your role, you must make sure that you remain highly technical, have a deep understanding of what is going on, and always keep learning.

Ideally this learning environment will be part of your job. If not, then evenings and weekends are a great time to learn, while you find another job that puts learning at the center of their ecosystem (if you love learning, that extra effort should feel like leisure/relaxing).
