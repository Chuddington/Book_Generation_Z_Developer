status: draft

...

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - How it blew up my home's telephone systems trying out BBS (I had to manually disconnect the phone line and recreate the plug to connect to the modem)
 - story on my first connections to an BBS (with sync communications) and the files I downloaded from them
 - story of the first BBS we published and the first couple users we had
 - expand on other network concepts
    - TCP vs UDP
    - Routers
    - NAT
 - publish your own server on your own broadband connection (easy to do)
 - see this video [Warriors of the net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBWhzz_Gn10) published in [2002](http://www.warriorsofthe.net/) which is a brilliant explanation of the internet, tcp packets and even security.  I remember being the first time I actually visualised how the internet and its multiple components work (now take a step back and realise that all of that happens in milliseconds around the world in today's technology)
    - these are really important concepts to understand
