...

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - story how to approach decisions
 - **'One-way door'** decisions - no way back (or hard to revert). Once you go through and the door is closed you can't open it back
 - **'Two-way door'** decisions - easy to revert decisions. You can open back the door after going through
 - in a lot of organizations, after a while there is an mis-understanding about the status of doors. i.e. there is a tendency that two-way doors and one-way doors, which leads to decision paralysis and adverse to take risks (i.e. open doors and try it)
 - this is related to the concept of fail-fast
 - Similar to story (I thinking from somebody in Google) that said "My metric for approve or not a project is based on how easy it is to roll back the changes (and its impact of real customers)'
