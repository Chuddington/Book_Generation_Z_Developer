**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - Ideas need to be protected
 - (find video of Steve Jobs and Jonny Ive talking about ideas)
 - http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-ideas-2014-3?IR=T
 - the more ideas you generate the more ideas you will have. Capture them on books, create hyperlinked connections between them
 - in my mind, ideas are like little fairies (which are fragile and precious and need to be protected/nurtured).
    - every time an idea is not captured and hyperlinked, it is like a killing one of those fairies (since in most cases those ideas will be lost forever)
