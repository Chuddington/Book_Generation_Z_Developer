...


**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - why it is big
 - what it means for programmers
 - massive job opportunities
 - the power of software vs hardware
 - it is all about code
 - security
    - most IOT vendors don't understand much about modern development practices and security
    - [shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) google for IoT (find tons of vulnerable devices)
    - IoT worms (example of power grid exploit)
        - the ones that generated billions of requests and Tb of data
    - hacking baby cameras and dools

  - developers have a big responsibility here
  - risk's mappings of reality could be a great way to get vendors to do the right thing
  - Electricity analogy (take current devices and add AI)
  - it is already amongst us (controled by Siri and Alexa)
    - what happens when these bots start to clash to one another (see[my 2020 vision, AI Edition](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-2020-vision-ai-edition-taras-novak) )
  - Arduino
    - What is it, why is it important, how much it costs
    - spend money on new IoT devices in kickstarter, for example on [Arduino](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?ref=nav_search&term=arduino) related projects (even better invent something and start a kickstarter campain, if that is successful, you will be highly employable)
    - get an arduino (or raspberry pi) and create your own IoT appliance for your home ( this is a great story to go on your CV)
