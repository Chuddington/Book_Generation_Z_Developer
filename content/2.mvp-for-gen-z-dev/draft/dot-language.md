title : Dot Language
status: draft
---

As a new developer joining the market, one of the real-world patterns that will surprise you the most is the lack of up-to-date documentation and diagrams about how the applications, services and even code behave (and even when they exists, they are usually out-of-date and not used on day-to-day decisions and coding). When you take a step back and think about this, you should realise that it is insane. What we do when developing software is to create large interconnected and complex structures without accurate maps and a solid understanding of what already exists and we are supposed to be building.

This doesn't happen because developers, architects or managers don't understand or value good up-to-date documentation. In fact they are usually the first ones to complain about these gaps. The problem is that most patterns and technologies used to create these diagrams are highly inefficient, time-consuming, complex and isolated.

[DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) is a text based representation of graphs which is a key part of the solution.

With DOT you describe the graph/diagram in text which is then transformed (by tools like [Graphwiz](http://www.graphviz.org/) or [vis.js](http://visjs.org/network_examples.html)) into a diagram.

Here is an example of DOT Language:

``` 
digraph G {
     size="2";     
     a [label="Foo"];     
     b [shape=box];     
     a -> b -> c [color=blue]
     b -> d [style=dotted];  
}
 ```

 Which looks like this when rendered (try this online at https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)

What you have here is 'Diagrams as code' which is a major paradigm shift that very few developers and professionals have been able to make. 

As you will see below, text-based representation of reality using diagrams is an area that still needs a lot of innovation and usage, I strongly recommend you to get your head around who to use DOT language for diagraming since that will give you a strong competitive advantage (specially if you are able to automate some/all of its creation)


#### Why we need diagrams

One of the key challenges that exist when working in a team with multiple stake-holders and areas of expertise, is the alignment of what are the objectives and what will be delivered. Don't underestimate how hard this is. Without a graphical representation of the plan and reality it is very hard to have that aligment

(Add image of situation were each person has a different understanding of the objective)

Actually, what we really need is Maps, but if we can start with Graphs that would be a great start



#### People, Process and Technology

....

#### Automatic generation of graphs for code

The reason why graph generation from text is so imporatnt

#### Infrastructure as Code 

### Version control graphs using Git

A key advantage of storing diagram data in a text format is that you are then able to use git to stored it and sites like GitHub to edit it.

The benefits are tremendous since now you are able to start treating your diagrams as you do your code, namely code/diagram reviews, branches for new features (to be merged when code is merged/live), use tags to mark releases/sprints, easily collaborate between multiple team members, and being able to do a diff between versions (i.e. see what changed between versions)

### Diff graphs and animate evolution

Your brain is really good at understanding patterns, but due to the highly efficient and hyperlinked way our brains works, what we think we remember from a diagram reviewed a couple days (or weeks) ago sometimes is not even a good representation of reality. This becomes a major problem when reviewing the diagrams for a 2nd, 3rd or nth time, since unless we are presented with 'what changed' since the last review, our brains really struggle to understand the meaning of those changes.

One of the nice side effects of storing diagram data in a text based format, is that diffing versions becomes possible (i.e. it is possible to create text and graphical representations of those changes). 

Diffing Diagrams (and making it as easy and smooth process), is is another area that we need quite a bit of innovation and a good area for you to become a player.

#### Why Visio doesn't scale

But why not use [Visio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visio), or one of its online/offline variations?

Visio diagrams are today the industry standard for creating detailed technical and workflow diagrams, and the reality is that Visio diagrams can look really good (specially if its creator has good design sense and good taste).

The irony is that Visio's main features are actually its main drawbacks. Due to the fact that Visio allows the creation of very detailed diagrams means that it is:

 - **very time consuming** - it is normal to take hours (if not days) to create an detailed diagrams 
 - **created from somebody's interpretation of reality** - the author of the Visio diagram will have a massive impact on the design, taxonomies, conventions and depth of detail, which means that it's personal bias and agenda will be reflected in the diagram
 - **a work of art** - yes some diagrams look really beautiful, but the point of a diagram is to help with data communication,   understanding and collaboration. The point should be to empower decisions, not to look good
 - **not created from dynamic data** - all elements in the Visio diagram are manually added, which means that once the original data/scenario/architecture changes, the diagram will be out-of-data
 - **layout is pixel based** - which means that moving anything can become really hard because the actually location of a particular element is 'hard-coded' to a particular location in the page (i.e. its pixel). This is one of the reasons why changes are so hard, since it is easy to hit clashes between elements, when moving/adding new elements
 - **locked to a particular design convention** - due to the fact that the design is hard-coded and the creator of the Visio diagram has enormous scope for applying its creative interpretation to the diagram's data, what ever convention the author used, becomes the one that everybody has to use. This becomes a massive issue when it is required to see the diagram's data from differnt points of view or different levels of abstraction 
 - **very easy to mix abstraction layers** - another common problem with Visio is the used of multiple abstractions in the same diagram (for example mixing network flows, with application flows, with user journey flows). This tends to be an side effect of not being able to reuse part of the diagram in new diagrams for example focused on a particular use-case or user-journey.
 - **stored in binary or xml format (very hard to diff)** - not only these files are hard/impossible to diff, some of the file formats are proprietary (i.e. not open) and sometimes on online services the data is not even available.
 - **mixes data and design in same file** - to effectively diff data it is key to store the data and the design in different files. Not only this will make the version diffing possible, it allows the creation of standard design templates (which will create a consistency of design, making it easier to consume)
 - **very hard to update** - once a diagram grows to a particular size, simple changes, can required considerate time (and big changes even more)
 - **not an accurate representation of reality** - due to the fact that these diagrams are hard to update, even in the unlikely situation that the diagrams were accurate on day 0 (i.e. when they were completed for the first time), due to the natural rate of change in development and systems, it is inevitable that the diagrams will start to go out of date. Them, unless they are significant efforts put in maintaining those diagrams, they stop being sources of truth (and valuable for teams)
 - **not used everyday (by developers, architects or managers)** - usually the reason for all the properties listed above, is the simple fact that the diagrams created are not part of the multiple day-to-day conversations and decisions that occur between the multiple players
 - **they are usually not maps** - finally the worse part of 99% of the diagrams out there is that that are not Maps, since they don't have visual, context (i.e. specific to purpose / perspective), anchor, position (relative to anchor), consistency of movement and components

####Â Not being able to control the layout is a feature

When you stat using text based diagraming tools like DOT one behaviors that will drive you crazy is the fact that The fact that you can't control the diagram layout (in the same way you do in Visio) is actually a major feature

#### Why diagrams are so important

#### The crazy idea that in Agile you don't need documentation

You need even more

To go fast go alone ... To go far go in a team .... To go fast and far make sure that everybody works together 

To go 

#### Evolution of Diagrams into Maps

#### Use Javascript engines 

vis.js is a great way to visualise DOT graphs

lots of innovation in this space (see for example the changes I have been working on in vis.js)


#### Mermaid and WebSequenceDiagrams.com

Another good example of diagram as code is the open source [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) tool, which is designed to help with chart generation.

Here is what a Sequence Diagram code looks like in Mermaid 

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
    John-->Alice: Great!
    John->Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->John: Jolly good!
```

Which looks like this when rendered:

An alternative is the propriatary https://www.websequencediagrams.com service, which more feature rich that mermaid and has a nicer design (the free version is already very usable and practical):

```
title Authentication Sequence

Alice->Bob: Authentication Request
note right of Bob: Bob thinks about it
Bob->Alice: Authentication Response
```

Will look like this

The [Diagram in R](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/index.html) integration page contains a great video of DOT in action:

Btw, if you have not learned how to code in [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), you definitely should, since it is a great way to manipulate and visualise data.
