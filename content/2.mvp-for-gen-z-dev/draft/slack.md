title: Slack and ChatOps
status: draft
---

Slack looks just like an evolution of instant messaging tools like Skype, MSN Messenger, SMS, ICQ, IRC or Smoke Signals. But the reason why Slack in a relative short period (5 years) as gained such adoption and traction, is because Slack's features enable organizations and communities to not only to change how they communicate, but how they behave, namely how they understand what is going on and how they respond to events.

Effective Communication and alignment are key competitive advantages of successful organizations. Slack provides an Asynchronous data/information exchange environment that can be at the epicenter of the multiple actors involved in the organization ecosystem: humans, bots, servers, applications, services and events.

The potential for change is enormous, and at the moment, most companies are only taking advantage of about 10% of Slack's capabilities. In most organizations Slack is at the _'replacing email'_ stage, which quickly is followed by the _'too many channels'_ and _'how do find what is going on without having to read a gigantic slack thread'_ phases (which can have diminishing returns)

The important question for you is: _"Are you going to take an active and proactive role in this change?"_. I can guarantee you that if you have hands on experience in the ideas and techniques described in this chapter, you have just increased your competitive advantage and employability.

### Why was Slack successful

Slack's success is a great case study of the power of marginal gains, where 

(another great example is British' cycle success (see '[How 1% Performance Improvements Led to Olympic Gold](https://hbr.org/2015/10/how-1-performance-improvements-led-to-olympic-gold')


Great article on the power of marginal gains, based on : strategy, human performance and continuous improvement.



This is what we want to see in security, where bit by bit we get better (starting small and then gaining speed)
- important to understand what they did right
- key features that really make it work (screenshots, fetch of links content, 3rd party integration), behaving has a central location of for incident handling, document sharing, conversation sharing)
    - emojies to communicate reactions and decisions


### ChatOps

The best concept that clearly explains the power What makes Slack so powerful is its ability to integrate with 3rd party tools, services and bots. This allows the creation of what has been labeled **ChatOps** (defined as _"a collaboration model that connects people, tools, process, and automation into a transparent workflow"_).

What this means is that you (as a developer) can use Slack as a communication medium for what is going on (in your live servers, test's execution or even build) and even more interesting, you can issue back commands and influence what is going on. 

Thinking and behaving in CAMS (Culture of Automation, Measurement and Sharing) is really hard. I strongly recommend you to write your own bot (using [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) or [Errbot](http://errbot.io/)), since it 

### Talking to yourself via Slack

### Use Slack as a debugger


### Security considerations
 - now a critical part of business
 - data protection and encryption
 - adopt snapchat security paradigms
 - better understanding (and logging) of who is seeing what (important for security incident handling) and ability to integrate with other authentication solutions (like OAuth)
    - ability to send access to logs to an AWS S3 bucket would be great
 - More granular control for bot access (in fact a mature API to manage access keys would be great)
 - More granularity in the pricing model (specially for some security features)
 

### Learn how to use Slack

As with every tool, you need to spend time in learning how to use it in order to be effective, and very importantly, not to be overwhelmed by the large number of channels and messages that you will get. When things get quite heavy, some times we call it 'Slack Tennis' since there is so much stuff bouncing around in multiple channels.

The first thing you need to remove is the Slack notifications and mute chatty channels that don't provide important information for your day to day activities. It is also important to not be afraid to leave a channel, since if you are needed, it is easy for others to bring you in with a mention of your name. The bottom line is that you need to consume Slack under your terms, not when a message arrives and you receive a dopamine kick. Slack is Async communication and you need to threat it like that.
