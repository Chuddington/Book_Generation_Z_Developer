title: Google and GDD
status: draft
---

As a developer one of the most important skills you need to learn is how to GDD.

GDD stands for is Google Driven Development, and it how every professional developer codes these days. Google's search engine is so powerful and effective, that when coding (and learning), google can answer questions much faster than anything else (including sites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) who is usually one of the answer's sources )

There is much more to Google than is 


In the age of Google being a verb, where you 'google something', how much do you really know how to use it? How much do you know about why and how Google was so successful? How much  

Google is one of the best Software engineering companies in the world, one of the first companies to do 'Scale' well.

**Topics to cover and ideas**
 
 - angular JS and Kubernetes, Chrome, Android
 - Google open source https://opensource.google.com/   Python founder and lead developer worked at Google
 - do you know how to use google?
    - show examples of powerful google searches
    - google docks (and finding vulns and credentials via google)
 - google's history 
    - clean UI
    - redirected traffic from other engines
 - why google won
 - what makes google algorithm work
 - How google tests software
 - SRE (book). lots of great concepts (like error Budgets)
 - show how google tracks all clicks (why you can't just copy an google's url)

 - Google move to graphs (see what happens when you search for a movie)
 - Google driven Development
 - show Google hacks (normal and security related)
 - Highlight the fact that google shows different searches to different people and different geographical regions
- Google Cloud (missed opportunity), google Borg

- mention Docker chapter , and rewrite 
   - Kubernetes (sometimes also called K8) was actually developed by Google and was inspired by [Google's Borg](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43438). The Borg is one of the key reasons why Google was able to scale massively in its web search and in services like GMail. Everything at Google is a container and as early as 2014 Google claimed to start [two billion](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/23/google_containerization_two_billion/) [containers per week](https://cloud.google.com/containers/)
- explain pagerank    
- explain adworks
- Gmail and GMaps history
- 20% to work on research projects
- Google approach to management and people management ('Work Rules' book). See [Not A Happy Accident: How Google Deliberately Designs Workplace Satisfaction](https://www.fastcompany.com/3007268/not-happy-accident-how-google-deliberately-designs-workplace-satisfaction)
- Google's [Chief Decision Officer](https://www.fastcompany.com/90203073/why-google-defined-a-new-discipline-to-help-humans-make-decisions) and the field of Decision Intelligence Engineering

- task: programmatically detect changes in google's behavior. Once you have a script that is able to use Google.com to search for results, you need to capture the responses (namely title and links) into an json file, and then compare it
- mention Alphabet
- explain how Google Links works (how they capture the link that you clicked)
- How Google Analytics works (gs.js)
