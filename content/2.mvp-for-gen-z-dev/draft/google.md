**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - angular JS and Kubernetes, Chrome, Android
 - Google open source https://opensource.google.com/   Python founder and lead developer worked at Google
 - do you know how to use google?
    - show examples of powerful google searches
    - google docks (and finding vulns and credentials via google)
 - google's history
 - why google won
 - what makes google algorithm work
 - How google tests software
 - SRE (book). lots of great concepts (like error Budgets)
 - show how google tracks all clicks (why you can't just copy an google's url)

 - Google move to graphs (see what happens when you search for a movie)
 - Google driven Development

- Google Cloud (missed opportunity), google Borg

- mention Docker chapter , and rewrite 
   - Kubernetes (sometimes also called K8) was actually developed by Google and was inspired by [Google's Borg](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43438). The Borg is one of the key reasons why Google was able to scale massively in its web search and in services like GMail. Everything at Google is a container and as early as 2014 Google claimed to start [two billion](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/23/google_containerization_two_billion/) [containers per week](https://cloud.google.com/containers/)
- explain pagerank    
- explain adworks

- task: programmatically detect changes in google's behavior. Once you have a script that is able to use Google.com to search for results, you need to capture the responses (namely title and links) into an json file, and then compare it
