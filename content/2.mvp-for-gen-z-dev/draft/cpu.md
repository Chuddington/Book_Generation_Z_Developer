**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - power of assembly, the importance of learning how to code in ASM
 - how assembly relates to bytecode in .Net (MSIL) and Java
 - spectre and meltdown vulnerability
 - I learned how to code assembly by hand
    - a bit difficult (I was 13 at the time) but I had only one book and no internet
    - manually translated assembly code into binary (I didn't had an asm compiler at the time)
    - I was learning massively about architecture, memory layout, programming, etc... (without noticing). I was in the 'zone'
    - totally worth it
    - learning about hardware interupts, TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident),and kernel vs user land memory did wonders for my understanding of Window's programming/architecture and computer science
 - when I was 16 I programmed on the Motorola 68000 which was much easier and more interresting (the 68000 CPU was used in the Amiga, and was much more powerful that the x86 architecure (we still used today))
 - my peek and poke moment: 'change a pixel on screen' (and falling in love with programming)
 - mention history of processors:
    -  Zilog Z80,Motorola 68000 and Intel x80, x286 and Pentium
        - "I remember when 286 was fast"

 - Great tools on windows are [ollydbg](http://www.ollydbg.de) and [Ida Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)
