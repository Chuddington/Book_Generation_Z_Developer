This section will try to define what should be the MVP for a Generation Z Developer.

MVP is a term used regularly in the software development industry to mean [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), and it represents the minimum set of features and capabilities that a particular product/release/version should have in order to add value to the end users/customers.

Drop me a link to these posts so that you have at least one reader :)
