**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - How they work
    - C/C++ programing will really help to understand how it works
 - how all methods calls in Java and .NET are pointers
 - how managed languages solve this
    - is .NET managed? (who is enforcing the type?)
 - understand the difference between Stack and Heap
 - understand and exploit buffer overflows (stack and heap based exploits)
    - Countermeasures
        - Canaries
        - ASLR (Address space layout randomization)
    - understanding how buffer overflows work will do wonders for your understanding on how memory works
