 - Change is the only constant
 - Enjoy lose briefs (they are an opportunity to refactor those briefs into something that you are good at)
 - put yourself in places where you are being highly productive while learning a lot.
    - find the sweet spot where you are adding a lot of value
 - view problems as oportunities (which can be broken down into smaller problems and tasks)
