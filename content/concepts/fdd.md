title: FDD (Feedback-Driven Development)

{{% panel theme="success" header="Topics to cover" %}}

 - real-time feedback in IDE (REPLs)
    - this is key to learn
    - run code as you lift your fingers or press save
 - show screenshot of my typical dev environment
 - wallabyjs
    - great example of what this UI needs to be
    - incredible how it has not be copied into all IDEs (as far as I can tell only NCrunch has the same features)
    - why is it so good
        - real time test execution
        - only execution of tests affected by changes
        - ability to see the code coverage in real-time
        - ability to easily just run one test
            - which with the real-time coverage, provides a much better way to debug that the normal 'debug/breakpoint model'

 - all code changes (except refactoring) should require a test change
