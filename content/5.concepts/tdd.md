title: TDD (Test-Driven Development)
---


**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - the most coverage you get, the more changes you are happy to make, the better the code is because you have the confidence to make the hundreds of small changes that the only way to create a high quality and scalable application
 - be a craftsman
 - explain history
 - key challenges
 - why the TDD community created dogma and lost the plot
 - if you don't have 100% code coverage, what are those bits of code not covered by tests? (what happens if that code changes)
 - everything should be tested
    - history of a site that went down for hours because of a one char (pipe) change in a nginx config file
 - explain BDD and Gherkin language


 ** bugs as features**

  - replicate bugs first (before trying to fix them)
