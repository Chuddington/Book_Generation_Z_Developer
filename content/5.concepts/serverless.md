**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - latest industry fad, but important development
 - of course that there is a server, just that the app abstraction goes up another level
 - this will be successfully becauuse it is massively cost effective (story of the crazy cost reductions and performance gains from moving to a lambda based architecture)
 - important to understand why is it gaining momentum
 - important to understand the limitations
 - another example of the failure of Techops to innovate
