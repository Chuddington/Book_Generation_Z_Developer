title: Chaos Engineering
---


**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - Great concept (from 2017)
 - Security has been doing this for ages
 - Add references to site and best posts
 - focus on resilient systems
 - need to understand and visualize what is going on
    - a massive problem with micro-services (and any services/monolith) based application is vibility into what is going on (and even just getting good graphs is the first step, just ask anybody who has deployed AppDynamics)
 - integrate this concept with the SRE's 'Error Budget'
 - expand on the concept of 'Steady state' (and write tests for it)
    - how we want tests to replicate it
