**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - history
 - why it worked
 - agile manifesto
    - https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/
        - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        - Working software over comprehensive documentation
        - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        - Responding to change over following a plan

 - [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
    - Not only working software             , but also well-crafted software
    - Not only responding to change         , but also steadily adding value
    - Not only individuals and interactions , but also a community of professionals
    - Not only customer collaboration       , but also productive partnerships

 - Anton cords
 - explain concepts (with diagrams)
 - how agile become dogma and created environments where agile teams where not agile at all
    - processes become more important than understanding why something was being created in the first place, to much effort was put on estimates, to much focus was placed on what could be done in 2 weeks
 - Scrumbam is a nice alternative

 - [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
