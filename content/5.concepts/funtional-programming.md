title: Functional Programming
---

...

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - explain how it works and the power of it
 - examples in Node
 - dangers of creating hard to read and debug code
    - I've seen cases where code exists that nobody really understands how it works (in Scala environments)
        - this is a security risk
        - developers though they were the problem (problem was function that was too complex)
        - it is not because you can that you should
        - code readability and maintainability (by the ones that have to maintain the code, not by the one who wrote it) is a big factor in the quality, value and risk of a piece of code
        - another situation is the ability to not create a full list of urls/endpoints (when function programming is used for handling web-requests)
 - when functions are objects
 - that said, when funtional programing is well used it can produce code that is super elegant and efficient
