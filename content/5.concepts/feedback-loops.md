...

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - key to create scalable workflows. it is all about effectiveness. 
 - Positive reinforcement, adjust to navigation
 - explain using feedback loops from control systems and engineering
 - TDD is a gigantic feedback loop 
 - Bret Victor's inventing on principle (https://vimeo.com/36579366) is all about feedback loops
 - not about just 'giving feedback' . the key for feedback loops is that the input will affect the output which will affect the input (good example are how a driver uses the driving wheel in a car)
 - used in music (to create special electric guitar sounds) 
 - one interesting challenge is how to measure it
 - I think I have a really good instinct for how feedback loops can exist in business and development 
- exponential growth can happen easily in an feedback loop
