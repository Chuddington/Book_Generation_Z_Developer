title: FDD (Feedback-Driven Development)
---


**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - real-time feedback in IDE (REPLs)
    - this is key to learn
    - run code as you lift your fingers or press save
 - show screenshot of my typical dev environment
 - wallabyjs
    - great example of what this UI needs to be
    - incredible how it has not be copied into all IDEs (as far as I can tell only NCrunch has the same features)
 - all code changes (except refactoring) should require a test change
    - see http://pitest.org/
    - see chaos engineering
 - every developer does tests all time
    - the question is how repeatable, scalable, mesuable those tests are
    - and how much context switching occurs

 - the FDD applies to much more than just coding (see chapter on "Inventing on Principle") it is also related to how we learn
