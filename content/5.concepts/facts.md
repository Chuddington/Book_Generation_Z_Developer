**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - be data and facts driven
 - science up your arguments (be intellectually curious)
 - check your sources
 - understand the agenda of who is talking to you
 - don't trust what is on the media namely when it is selling fear (after all if it is on the media it is because it is rare)
 - FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) - Used to be used a lot in the technology sector
 - we are living in challenging times which and it is important to understand that facts and solid science are how we need to think about problems and solutions.
   - not to say that we need to have 100% facts and assurance before decisions are made, but it is important to try to have 'fact based decisions' as much as possible
