**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming
 - idea that pair programming is not optimal at the moment
 - When I code in a 'real-time coding environment' I am pair programming with myself
 - a much more interesting pair programing model is one where programmer A codes and programmer B writes the test
    - this is a situation where we actually want the more experienced programmer to be writing the code, since for code to scale we want 'coding excellence as BAU'
    - the more powerful and effective code the code written by the less experienced developer, the more scalable and effective the current development environment is
    - specially important, given the current skills shortage with developers and the companies preference to use an XYZ budget to hire 2x less experienced developers vs 1x more experience developers
