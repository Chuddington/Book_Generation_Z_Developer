...

**Topics to cover and ideas**

 - explain what it is
 - Steve Jobs and Jon Ive on Design
 - It's about everything
 - 'Design of everyday things' book
 - Design is not about how things look, it is about how they work
 - Microsoft approach to design (story about how for J.Ive change is not a desirable goal, but a side effect of good design)
 - with good design, evolution feel natural and the current status quo quickly feels out of date
 - attention of detail , making it work
 - Simple is very hard (you know it is right when there is nothing to add and remove (without severely affecting the meaning))
 - 'I don't have time to send you a short letter so I'm going to send a long one' 
 - constant refactoring is how we get to good design
    - speed of iteration , beats quality of design (and ironically the speed of iteration will create a more quality outcome)
