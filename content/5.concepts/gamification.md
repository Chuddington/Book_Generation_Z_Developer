 - Game Theory
 - add Ted talk on it
 - You (Gen Z) see this everyday in your digital interactions (the badges, the nudgets, the rewards, the streaks)
    - you are being manipulated into being hooked into the apps your used
    - you are the product, not the client
    - there are teams that their job is to find more ways to hook you (and your time) into their platform
        - supported by lots of Science and Research (into how we consciously and unconsciously behave)
    - understand when you are being played (or brains are not designed to control the stimulus we receive)
 - the power of nudges and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
 - that said, as a developer this is a really powerful skil to have
    - when developing gamification systems quick feedback loops are critcal
