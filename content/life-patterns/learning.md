 - if you are not passionate about learning, you are on the wrong job
 - you need to learn 10 languages and be on a constant learning curve
    - each language will tech you something new (only the first 5 will be hard)
    - for example very hard to learn about functional programming until coding in Node or Scala
 - the age of the 'professional amateur'
 - the trap of 'management' which removes learning opportunities (and most of the time is spent on meetings and 'non learning environments'). It is key to remain technical and to always keep learning

 - learning to learn is one of the best skills that one can learn at school
