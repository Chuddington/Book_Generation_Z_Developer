Hi Generation Z Developer, if you are passionate developer who wants to learn as much as you can about your craft, this is the book for you.

I decided to write this book after doing a series of presentations to Gen Z audiences, where I realised that there a number of key gaps in your generation understanding of the history behind a number of key technologies that underpin the technological revolution that we are the in middle of.

Here is the slide that started it all:

![](/images/list-of-icons.png)

It all started by me asking the audience if they recognized those logos, and realising that not only they didn't recognised the logos, they didn't knew the history behind them (and more importantly why they where created and what problem they solved)

All these icons where 'catalysts of change' and it is important to understand the history behind them, why they occured, and what happened next

Each one of these icons changed the world of technology, and the paradigms shifts that they created and still impacting our world today.

One of these changes/revolutions was the Creative Commons copyright license, which was one of my _'WFT you don't know what that means'_ realizations. Basically it means you are free (as in freedom) to use all the materials and content from this book in whatever way you want. As you will seen thorough the book, what I find interesting, is not that that a particular technology or ideas allows X to happen. What matters to me are the ways those ideas change how we act, how we think and how we behave.

We are in the middle of a massive technological revolution and you need to decide if you want to be a pawn or a play-maker in this new world. If you don't understand the past, you are bound to not only repeat the mistakes, but you will not even understand what game is being played

Please join me in this interesting trip down memory lane, where I will try to explain how I understand and learned from a multitude number of technologies, ideas and events.
