Generation Z is the generation that was [born after 1996](https://twitter.com/PaoliCGPI/status/961121404048601088). Like all generation boundaries, the differences may be generalized and there will always be exceptions to the rule, but when viewed constructively it represents an interesting mix of great values and digital capabilities.

The older members of this generation (at the time of writing, 2018) are about 22 years old. They were 11 when the first iPhone come out (2007) and are the first real 'born online' generation. In parts of the world that are privileged enough to enjoy ubiquitous access to technology, many of this generation have not experienced a world without ready access to the internet on some kind of device. This is the generation that is entering the market right now.

I have personal experience of this generation, I have two daughters currently aged 13 and 15, and I have also been professionally involved in a number of projects focused on Generation Z. I've run sessions teaching high school kids in the UK how to 'hack' (in the traditional, rather than illegal sense of the word) and sessions teaching younger developers coding skills they would be able to apply in real world scenarios.

I'm focusing on Generation Z because I believe they've missed the historical understanding of a number of key technology revolutions in order to be competitive in the market place. At the current pace of technological advancement, so much history can be taken for granted. Without a full understanding of the past, we only learn from shadows and curated versions of reality.

**I'm worried about Gen Z**

Although Generation Z has some spectacular features and values, I occasionally perceive a lack of intellectual curiosity that worries me. This is arguably the most tolerant and diversity aware generation, but having grown up with an innate acceptance of the technology around us, many of the building blocks of todays technology stacks are simply assumed to be ever present, much like driving a car or flying a plane with no knowledge of the engineering.

This is a huge advantage in a sense; many of the boundaries that are more imagined than real for older generations don't inhibit Generation Z. By the same token however, even more opportunity comes from understanding the origin, history and stories of the technology journey so far.

This is an age when information and knowledge is a click or google search away. Yet, in conversation after conversation with Generation Z teenagers, I've found - not unsurprisingly - that they have a very superficial understanding of the history that underpins the technologies they use, how and why they came to be in the first place and the original problems the technology tried to solve.

My hope with this book is to break through these gaps and provide context and references and inform better decisions. For those that doubt how important this may be, remember: it's this generation that will need to save the world from the mess previous generations have created.

**Overwhelming curiosity**

How will I know this book worked? I'm hopeful that reading it can provide a couple moments of overwhelming curiosity from learning more about the various topics. The moments where you may start to follow link after link about a particular topic, and that, no matter how brief it may be, you think 'WOW, that is fr**** awesome!'.

If you are lucky enough to find yourself in this place, congratulations - you just found 'the zone'. An amazing environment where you have the chance to be single minded and 100% absorbed, which is the best way to learn.

Whenever you find yourself in this headspace, dont stop! Follow it as long as your brain allows it, and don't stop for anything. Social events, eating and sleeping can always wait (more or less; respect your physical and mental health and never take them granted). The 'zone' is a magical place to be, so learn to recognize when you find yourself inside it, and use it to explore as much as you can.
