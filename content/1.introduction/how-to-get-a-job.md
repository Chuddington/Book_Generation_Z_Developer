title: How to get a job

One of my objectives with his book is to help you to find a job. There is a lot of competition out there and if you look at what is coming next (namely AI and the next billion of internet users), you need to maximise your changes

I really like the Gen Z realization that a job is something that should be rewarding and not just a way to make money. After all the best job is when you are paid to do something that you would do for free. Although I am very fortunate to be in that situation, where I love my job and what I do every day, that didn't happened by accident. I made a number of key decisions in my life (some with very short-term negative implications) that allowed me to align what I love to do with what the market wants to pay.

**Being passionate**

Find what you are passionate for, what you really care about, and align your carrer with those ideas. The best part is that this is a massive win-win situation, since the more passionate you are about a particular topic, the more you care about it, and the more valuable you are the company that is employing you to work on those topics.

**Own your carer development**

You are the one tha is in change of your carer. Don't let anybody tell you what you should be doing and what paths to follow. You need to discover these paths by yourself (via trial and error), and a great way to do that is to work for companies that are alligned with those paths

And how do you start working with those companies?

Easy, start collaborating on their Open Source projects. Act like you are part of the company (understand its values, and behave in was that add value to that company, namely the tech stack)

Start meeting key individuals (and developers) from those companies, and build relationships that not only will teach you a lot, but can potentially lead to very interesting job offers (or references). Start learning how to add value and how to become really good at proactively solving problems (which is one of the most valuable assets you can bring to a company)

What is interesting is that there is nothing stopping you from doing this?

So why don't you?

After all you have nothing to lose? (and all to gain)
