{{% panel theme="success" header="Topics to cover" %}}

 - See lack of intellectual curiosity in Gen Z
 - we need to learn from the past (in order not to repeat it), but lots of key technological revolutions and paradigm shifts seem to be not understood by Gen Z
    - It is important to learn the history of particular technoligies, namely why they occured in the first place (and what problem they tried to solve)

 - based on one of first slides presented a multiple Gen Z training sessions and presentations that I did in early 2018 (from 14 till 25 year olds)

 - you should have "overwhelming curiosity", when in the zone, be single minded, 100% focus on what you are learning

 - learning to learn
